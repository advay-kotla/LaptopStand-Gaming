This is my journal of the design and building process of the Laptop Stand. You can view this journal in more detail on Hack Club Blueprint

// 1 - Start and Sloped Top

I created a new project on Onshape and started with a simple and plain rectangular box. I cut a big angle across the entire top surface to make the main wedge shape. It gave it a slant look and add that triangular side look. This was the first major step for the look.

// 2 - Adding Top Vents/Holes


I drew and cut out the first triangular holes on the sloped top. These openings are crucial for internal space and for ensuring sufficient airflow for ventilation. I used the existing center planes to make sure both cutouts were placed correctly and had the right angle relative to the overall body.

// 3 - Deep Side Cuts (Aesthetic)


I kept working on the cutouts to make the design look better and more aggressive. Instead of simple holes, I started making deeper, more complex angular cuts into the side faces. My idea was to give this laptop stand a gaming theme so it kinda looked like smth based off a game. I sketched irregular, multi-sided shapes onto the side planes and then used the Cut tool to remove material, giving the housing a more interesting, detailed appearance.

// 4 - Making the Stepped Sides & Cool Designs to the Laptop Stand

The side look needed a cool "stepped" or layered look to match the wedge shape. This complex material removal took the longest time block. I created temporary planes offset from the main axes to help define the exact position and depth of the multiple deep, angled cuts. I checked the model after each cut to make sure the remaining material walls were still thick enough to be sturdy. I also made sure to add more holes to the laptop stand good because they promote ventilation, which helps cool the laptop and prevent performance issues. This airflow also helps extend the life of the laptop by reducing the risk of overheating. Additionally, holes can be designed for cable management to reduce clutter and improve the look of a workspace. Just for clarfication in this step I did not actually make a deep hole, I just ended up tracing where to keep the holes.

// 5 - Checking and Mirroring & making deep cuts


Since the laptop case needs to be perfectly balanced, I made sure all the complex cuts I made on the first side (the vents, the deep side cuts, and the steps) were perfectly copied or mirrored to the other side of the body. I also spent time running checks for any small spots where the cuts might have overlapped or created conflicting geometry that would cause issues when trying to 3D print or machine the part. The entire outside shape was finalized here.

// 6 - Adding Feet/Mounts


For the last part of the project, I focused on the practical features, adding the small, square feet/brackets that stick out on the bottom surface near the corners. These features are meant to hold rubber anti-slip pads or secure the top and bottom halves of the case together with screws, and adding them completed the whole look of the model.
