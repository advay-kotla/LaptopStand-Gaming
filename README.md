# LaptopStand-Gaming


Project Overview

This repository contains the CAD files and journaling for my custom designed laptop case (Project "Apex"). The main goal of this project was to create a highly aesthetic, sharp, and futuristic look, focusing heavily on geometric complexity and  ventilation. The design is intended for 3D printing or CNC machining from aluminum or high-density plastic. I was inspired by an idea of creating a laptop stand to add to my gaming setup and I wanted to make something that applied to the gaming theme. 


Design Features


Wedge Profile: The main body features a continuous, sloping top surface, creating a wedge shape from front to back.

Integrated Vents: Angular, triangular cutouts are added into the top surface for active cooling airflow as without a ventilzation system the laptop stand would overheat.

Stepped Side Walls: The side profiles feature complex, layered cuts to give it a multi dimensional look.
